# CCD
Climate Change Driver - An application project to spot Higher-Alert Man-Made natural disasters in your country

# REQUIRED PACKAGES:

*facebook-sdk 
*tweepy
*MySQLdb (python package)
*wxpython (+ wxpython libs, extensions)

# USAGE:

First you will have to create your mysql database and your login credentials to connect with the database.
After that, you must specify the country name in your API GET requests to find all data about what's happening in your country. 
You must be careful with social network APIs, they're very limiting and sometimes you'll have to tweak some parameters for the alert system to work fine.
Alert updates are automatic every two minutes (any tweaking to a lower value will cause no update due to exhaustive threading)
After updated, you can view the database tables and copy down the data you want
